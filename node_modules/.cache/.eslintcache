Also known as information technology (IT) security, \r\n          cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.\r\n          In 2020, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally, and USD 8.64 million in the United States.</p>\r\n        <p>These costs include the expenses of discovering and responding to the breach, the cost of downtime and lost revenue, \r\n          and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand. Cyber criminals target customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) — names, addresses, national \r\n          identification numbers (e.g., Social Security number in the US, fiscal codes in Italy), and credit card information — and then sell these records in underground digital marketplaces. \r\n          Compromised PII often leads to a loss of customer trust, the imposition of regulatory fines, and even legal action. </p>\r\n        <p>Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy,\r\n           governed by best practices and automated using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, can fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and\r\n            impact of breaches when they occur.

This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.</p>\r\n        <p>Virtualization enables cloud providers to make maximum use of their data center resources. Not surprisingly, many corporations have adopted the cloud delivery model for their on-premises infrastructure so they can realize maximum utilization and cost savings vs. traditional IT infrastructure and offer the same self-service and agility to their end-users.</p>\r\n        <p>If you use a computer or mobile device at home or at work, you almost certainly use some form of cloud computing every day, whether it’s a cloud application like Google Gmail or Salesforce, streaming media like Netflix, or cloud file storage like Dropbox. According to a recent survey, 92% of organizations use cloud today (link resides outside IBM), and most of them plan to use it more within the next year.

IT plays such an important role in business operations today and significantly affects how we exchange information and communicate in our daily lives. It's no wonder that the IT job outlook is exceptionally bright. </p>\r\n        <p>Information technology's scope often extends well beyond what most people think. To provide some structure on the ins and outs of careers in IT, it's helpful to think about it broken down into three essential categories: operations, infrastructure installation and maintenance, and governance.</p>\r\n        <p>We've all benefited from IT professionals who troubleshoot our computer or technology issues so we can carry on with our business. There are more roles and specialties in the IT field than meets the eye, including governing roles that manage and oversee the efficacy of IT's impact in an organization. There's also professionals who specialize in tangible, hands-on materials such as routers and servers.
